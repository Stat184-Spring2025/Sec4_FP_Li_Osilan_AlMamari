# Global COVID-19 Trends: Cases, Vaccinations, and Healthcare Burden

This project investigates how the COVID-19 pandemic affected countries differently by analyzing infection trends, vaccination effectiveness, and ICU usage patterns. Using global datasets, we explore the relationship between public health interventions and outcomes through visual and statistical analysis in R.

## Overview

COVID-19 reshaped global health policy, overwhelmed hospitals, and challenged public infrastructure. In this project, we use publicly available data from trusted sources to answer the following questions:

1. **How did daily case counts change across major countries over time?**
2. **What is the relationship between vaccination rates and death rates in the US?**
3. **How did ICU capacity respond to COVID-19 waves across countries?**

Through careful data cleaning, transformation, and visualization in R, we aim to uncover patterns that could inform future pandemic responses.

## Interesting Insight

Countries with high vaccination rates generally experienced lower COVID-19 death rates, but this trend wasn‚Äôt uniform. Some well-vaccinated countries still faced high mortality, hinting at the role of health infrastructure and response time.
