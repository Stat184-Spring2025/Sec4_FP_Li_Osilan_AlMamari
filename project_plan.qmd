# Project Plan

## Step 1: Data Collection

**Objectives:**
- Assemble all necessary datasets from reliable, publicly available sources.
- Ensure all datasets are updated, consistent, and cover the target timeframe (2020â€“2023).

**Tasks:**

1.1. Gather daily confirmed COVID-19 case data from:
- Johns Hopkins CSSE COVID-19 Data Repository (via CSV or API).
- COVID-19 Data Hub R package if needed.

1.2. Gather vaccination data including:
- Total doses administered.
- Number of people partially and fully vaccinated.
- Vaccination rates per hundred people.

1.3. Assemble ICU healthcare stress indicators:
- Number of ICU patients.
- ICU bed capacity (if available).
- Hospitalization rates.

1.4. Focus countries:
- United States
- United Kingdom
- Canada
- China
- Singapore

## Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

**Objectives:**
- Prepare datasets for analysis by ensuring consistency, completeness, and usability.

**Tasks:**

2.1. Clean the datasets by:
- Removing duplicate rows.
- Handling missing values (either by imputation or removal depending on extent).
- Standardizing country names and date formats.

2.2. Perform necessary joins/merges:
- Combine case counts, vaccination rates, and ICU occupancy into a single unified dataset by `Country` and `Date`.

2.3. Create meaningful derived variables:
- Vaccination coverage rate: `% fully vaccinated population`.
- Case fatality rate: `(deaths / confirmed cases) * 100`.
- ICU usage rate: `(icu_patients / estimated ICU capacity)` if data available.

2.4. Filter datasets:
- Focus only on data from 2020 to 2023.
- Include only the five countries selected.

## Step 3: Research Questions and Visualizations

**Objectives:**
- Answer core research questions through carefully designed plots and summaries.

**Research Questions & Associated Plots:**

3.1. **How did daily COVID-19 case counts evolve across countries over time?**
- Line plots of new daily cases by country from 2020 to 2023.
- Facet wrap by country to show comparative timelines.
- Highlight key surge periods (e.g., Delta and Omicron waves).

3.2. **What is the relationship between vaccination rates and death rates?**
- Scatter plot:
  - X-axis: % fully vaccinated population.
  - Y-axis: death rate per 100,000 people.
  - Color points by country or year.
- Add trendline (linear regression or LOESS) to detect correlation.

3.3. **How did ICU occupancy change during pandemic surges?**
- Stacked area chart or grouped bar chart:
  - ICU patients per country over months.
  - Compare against surges in cases.

3.4. (Optional) Additional plot:
- Map visualization (small world map) showing vaccination rates by country.

## Step 4: Final Analysis and Reporting

**Objectives:**
- Summarize results, draw conclusions, and prepare final deliverables.

**Tasks:**

4.1. Write an introduction summarizing background context and goals.

4.2. For each research question:
- Present associated plots.
- Provide short written explanations interpreting the observed trends.

4.3. Discussion Section:
- Compare findings across countries.
- Highlight surprises, expected patterns, and possible causes (e.g., vaccine hesitancy, variant emergence, healthcare infrastructure).

4.4. Conclusion Section:
- Summarize the main lessons learned.
- Suggest future research directions.

4.5. Cite all datasets properly using `.csl` files.

4.6. Compile and render final report in `.pdf` format using Quarto.

# Notes

- Large datasets (e.g., OWID full data) will not be pushed to GitHub; a local download script will be provided.
- Ensure consistent citation style using APA format (.csl file applied in Quarto).
